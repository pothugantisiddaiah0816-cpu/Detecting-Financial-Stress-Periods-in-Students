# Detecting Financial Stress Periods in Students

This project analyzes student attendance and simulated fee payment delays to identify periods of financial stress and potential academic risk.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Delayed fee payments can be an early sign of financial difficulties, which may impact student attendance and academic performance.  
This project aims to detect financial stress patterns by combining fee delay data with attendance behavior.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Hex (SQL + Dashboard)
- SQL for data processing
- Data Visualization (Bar charts, Line charts)

## 📊 Key Features
- Classification of students into Low, Medium, and High Stress levels  
- Visualization of student counts by stress category  
- Analysis of average attendance rate across stress levels  
- Relationship between fee delay days and attendance rate  

## 📈 Insights
- A large proportion of students fall under the High Stress category due to delayed fee payments.  
- Students with higher stress tend to show slightly lower attendance rates.  
- Longer payment delays increase the likelihood of Medium and High Stress classification.  
- Prolonged financial stress may lead to irregular attendance and academic risk.

## 🏁 Conclusion
Fee payment delay combined with attendance data can act as a strong early warning system for identifying financially stressed students and enabling timely academic support.
